### Overview 
In this project, the objective is to understand the basic of microservice  architecture by implementing a very simple blog application ; Where user can create a blog post and allowing users to create comments on them . When an user first come to our application we are gonna show a below  form through which user can create posts .

Once they do so, we're then going to display the posts they just created down here at the bottom,
the screen. That would be the post that was just created. We'll show the title, the post will show the number of comments it was associated with it, and we'll also have a little forum right here to add some comments to that individual post.
